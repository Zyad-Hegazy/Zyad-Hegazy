## 🧠 About Me

I build systems close to the metal.

My primary language is **C**, and I focus on embedded systems, automotive electronics, and low-level development.  
I enjoy understanding machines at their core — firmware, control logic, hardware integration, and real-time constraints.

Currently:
- 🏎 Head of Embedded Systems – Formula Student Team  
- 🔌 Working with Arduino  
- 🚀 Starting STM32 & ESP32 development  
- ⚙️ Building automotive and low-level experimental tools  

I aim to continuously refine my depth and move toward elite-level engineering through discipline and exploration.
